# Recruit.me
Our project is built to serve the purpose of simplifying and enchancing recruitment process in industries. The companies just need to float a form. The form asks information from student about user details of competitive programming sites (like
[codechef](https://www.codechef.com), [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) or development platform (like [github](https://github.com/)). After successful submission of the form, the user's performance and contribution on those sites will be extracted. This information will be
represented in a csv file. The web App is  designed for students and Interviewers.
